## Disclaimers
There are some known areas for improvement:

- This app depends upon related libraries that it uses. There may be bugs.
- This wallet currently only supports transacting between shielded addresses, which makes it incompatible with wallets that do not support sending to shielded addresses. 
- Traffic analysis, like in other cryptocurrency wallets, can leak some privacy of the user.
- The wallet requires a trust in the lighthttps server to display accurate transaction information. 
- This app has been developed and run exclusively on `mainnet` it might not work on `testnet`.  

See the [Wallet App Threat Model](https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/wallet_threat_model.html)
for more information about the security and privacy limitations of the wallet.
